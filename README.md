# aboutme

Some things about me:
    I am 25 and the eldest of three kids.
    One of my favorite video games is Skyrim, but I also enjoy (most) of the Fallout series.
    My favorite movie is either Howl's Moving Castle or Indiana Jones The Last Crusade. 
    Some of my hobbies include photography, drawing and painting miniatures for TTRPGs.
